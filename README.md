This boilerplate is designed to help front-end development by providing a bunch of configurable common commands.  
Ideally, this boilerplate should remain as unopiniated as possible but there is still a few conventions to follow.

The philosophy behind this boilerplate is to have a portable development environment which explains why this is not 
an empty project to clone but an npm package to install as a devDependency.  
If the development environment has to be updated, this could be spread easily among dependents.

## Features
* [webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)
* [babel](https://github.com/babel/babel)
* [mocha](https://mochajs.org/)
* [chai](http://chaijs.com/)
* [eslint](http://eslint.org)
* [less](http://lesscss.org/)

## Requirements
* node `^4.4.0`
* npm `^3.4.0`

## Setup
Install it as a devDendency:

```bash
$ npm i web-component-env --save-dev
```

Once the installation is done, the main command `wce` is accessible in the `bin` folder of `node_modules`:

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/wce
```

A list of available subcommand shoud appear:

|`./node_modules/.bin/wce <command>`|description|
|-----------------------------------|-----------|
|`start`|serves the app at `localhost:3000` with hmr|
|`lint`|lint all `.js` files|
|`test`|runs unit tests with mocha and generates coverage report with nyc|
|`bundle`|compiles the application to disk|

*find below detailed documentation about the commands*

## Application Structure

The application structure is free apart few conventions:

```
.
├── src                      # application source code
│   ├── app.js               # application bootstrap and rendering
│   ├── index.js             # library bootstrap and rendering
└── test                     # unit tests
```

*I strongly suggest to adopt a [modular-based structure](https://gist.github.com/nicolas-briemant/0b29950369ec385b16d4b43ca5585e62) 
which generally leads to more scalable and maintainable applications.*

## Commands

### start

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/wce start
```

`start` serves the application from `src/app.js`.  
It relies on webpack and provides **hot module replacement** and **sourcemaps** to ease developments.  
Currently, the `index.html` template is automatically generated by wce.

Host and port can be configured (default is `localhost:3000`):

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/wce start --host localhost --port 3000
# or
$ ./node_modules/.bin/wce start -h localhost -p 3000
# or
$ HOST=localhost PORT=3000 ./node_modules/.bin/wce start
```

*The process can be terminated by writting kill, Windows often fails to terminate all nodes processes by using ctrl+c.*

### lint

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/wce lint
```

`lint` lint all `.js` files in `src` and `test` folders.  
A [default configuration](https://github.com/nicolas-briemant/web-component-env/blob/master/.eslintrc) is provided and can currently not be overridden.

Target files can be configured (default is `src/**/*.js* test/**/*.js*`):

```bash
$ ./node_modules/.bin/wce lint --pattern src/my-module
# or
$ ./node_modules/.bin/wce lint --p src/**/reducer.js test/test.js
```

*pattern option accepts globbing and several entries*

### test
### bundle
